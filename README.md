# Pair-Game
My 1st project was in the "Advance Programming" course at spring 2016 when I was in the 2nd semester of my bachelor's at IAUSTB. Pair games comprise a single player and reaching full score game. This game consists of a table that is filled with pair numbers in the random cells. Given that you discover two same numbers in a different place then a specified score will be earned and if your selected cells do not match then you lose the score. I used Java Swing to build its GUI.
